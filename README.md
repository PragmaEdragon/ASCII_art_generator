# ASCII_art_generator
Generating ascii arts with python via command prompt.
## How it works? 
     The input is a picture of one of the selected formats. After that, each pixel is processed, compressed and repainted in gray. Then a little magic happens that transforms the pixels into a specific sequence of ASCII characters.
